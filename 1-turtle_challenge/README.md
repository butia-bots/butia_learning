# Turtle Challenge

This challenge is meant to introduce some basic ROS concepts to new users, however it assumes youâ€™re familiar with fundamental ROS concepts, including creating and building packages and running nodes.

The task is to develop a ROS node to control a turtle. The node must be capable of guiding the turtle to form a square in the turtlesim simulator.

## How to develop the challenge

The challenge node should publish [Twist](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) messages in the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic in order to make the turtle form a square.

To implement this behavior, you should modify the execute() method of the ChallengeNode node provided in this repository. Then run the simulator:

```bash
cd fbot_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

And the node: 

```bash
ros2 run turtle_challenge challenge_node
```
